Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project implements a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of diabetes using the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset.
The workflow includes dataset preprocessing, train-test splitting, model training, evaluation, and finally a Tkinter-based GUI for user-friendly predictions.

 Features

Load and preprocess the diabetes dataset.

Train a Logistic Regression model on the dataset.

Evaluate the model using accuracy score.

Simple Tkinter GUI for real-time predictions:

Users can input medical parameters.

The system predicts whether the person is Diabetic or Not Diabetic.
